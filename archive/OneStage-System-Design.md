# OneStage — System Design

> **Archived: original design, August 2026.** This document records the design as first planned. The system as built differs in several ways (see `architecture/00-overview.md`, "Original design versus the system as built"). For the current design, read `architecture/`. Kept unchanged below as a historical record.

*SWE5001 — Architecting Scalable Systems, Graduate Certificate in Architecting Scalable Systems (NUS–ISS)*

Data models, domain class diagrams, and API surface for the four backend services, derived from the [user stories](https://claude.ai/code/artifact/7a3e1db9-56dc-4d3f-8bc1-3c5d870a97a2). One Amazon RDS for MySQL instance plays four independent databases via schema-per-service; Cognito owns authentication; a single SQS queue carries the one hand-off that can safely be asynchronous.

**At a glance:** 4 backend services · 1 MySQL instance, 4 schemas · 12 tables · 31 API endpoints · 1 SQS queue.

## Architecture overview

Three static single-page apps (Buyer, Organizer Portal, Scanner) are served from S3 via CloudFront and call the backend over HTTPS with a Cognito JWT. Path-based routing on a single ALB/API Gateway sends each request to the right ECS service. Every service owns one schema in one shared MySQL instance — there is no cross-schema foreign key anywhere in this design, only plain columns that reference another schema's row by id, exactly as if each service had its own database.

## Design decisions

**One database, four schemas, no cross-schema foreign keys.** A single Amazon RDS for MySQL instance hosts `event_inventory`, `queue`, `checkout`, and `ticketing` — one per service — instead of four separate RDS instances, which keeps the school project's AWS bill and ops surface small. Each service's own tables carry real, enforced foreign keys. A reference to another service's row (e.g. `checkout.orders.event_id`) is stored as a plain unconstrained column instead, so the services stay logically independent and could be split onto separate instances later with zero schema change.

**Only one thing has to be synchronous: not overselling.** The one failure OneStage cannot tolerate is two buyers being confirmed for the same seat. So reserving and confirming an `InventoryHold` happens inside the Event & Inventory Service under a DB transaction, and Checkout calls `POST /holds/{id}/confirm` synchronously before it will mark an order `PAID` — if that call fails, the sale fails. Ticket generation and the confirmation email are not on that critical path, so Checkout instead publishes `OrderPaid` to the `order-events` SQS queue and Ticket Issuance consumes it asynchronously. That's the proposal's "event bus that decouples inventory and order events from downstream processing," scoped to the one hand-off where eventual consistency is actually fine.

**Authorization rides on one small table, not a fifth service.** Cognito authenticates every request, but Organiser/Helper are per-event roles that don't map onto global Cognito groups. `event_team_memberships` in the Event & Inventory schema is the single source of truth: creating an event auto-inserts its creator as `ORGANISER`, and every organiser-or-helper-scoped endpoint in any service checks it via a synchronous internal call to `GET /events/{eventId}/team-members/{userSub}`. Every other endpoint just requires a valid Cognito JWT — any signed-in user is a Customer by default. Removing a member is a **soft revoke**, not a delete: `status` flips to `REVOKED` and `revoked_at` is stamped, so the row stays as an audit record of who had access to an event and when. Re-adding the same person later reactivates that row (updates `status`, `granted_by_sub`, `granted_at`) rather than inserting a duplicate, so the `(event_id, user_sub)` uniqueness constraint still holds.

**What's deliberately left out.** Cognito's own login/token-refresh flow, network firewalls and WAF rules, a service mesh, and rate limiting beyond the waiting room's own admission control are all out of scope. IDs below are plain auto-increment `BIGINT`s rather than UUIDs, and every "email" field is a denormalized snapshot taken from the Cognito JWT at write time, so no service has to call another just to render a name.

## Event & Inventory Service — `event_inventory` schema

The platform's core technical risk: owns events, their inventory (GA quantity or a seat map), event-team roles, and the concurrency-safe hold that guarantees a seat or quantity is never sold twice.

## Waiting Room / Queue Service — `queue` schema

Sits in front of Tier 2 on-sales only. Holds no inventory of its own — it just orders customers into a line and admits them in batches, checking availability against the Event & Inventory Service before letting anyone through.

## Ticket Issuance & Validation Service — `ticketing` schema

## Tier 2 purchase — sync vs. async in one picture

The flow that justifies every choice above: the queue and the inventory hold are synchronous because correctness can't wait; publishing to SQS and issuing the ticket happen after the customer already has a confirmed, paid order.

    actor C as Customer (Buyer App)
    participant WR as Waiting Room / Queue Service
    participant EIS as Event & Inventory Service
    participant CPS as Checkout & Payment Service
    participant SQS as SQS: order-events
    participant TIV as Ticket Issuance & Validation Service

    C->>WR: POST /queue/join
    WR-->>C: queue position (polls /queue/me)
    WR->>WR: admission worker admits next batch
    WR-->>C: ADMITTED + admission token

    C->>EIS: POST /inventory/hold (seats/qty, admission token)
    EIS->>EIS: reserve within DB transaction (no oversell)
    EIS-->>C: hold created, expiresAt

    C->>CPS: POST /orders (holdId)
    CPS-->>C: order PENDING
    C->>CPS: POST /orders/{id}/payment (simulated)
    CPS->>EIS: POST /holds/{id}/confirm  (sync — must succeed before order is PAID)
    EIS-->>CPS: hold CONFIRMED
    CPS->>CPS: mark order PAID
    CPS-->>C: order PAID
    CPS->>SQS: publish OrderPaid  (async — decouples issuance)
    SQS-->>TIV: deliver OrderPaid
    TIV->>TIV: issue ticket(s), generate QR
    TIV-->>C: email ticket with QR (async)
```

A Tier 1 purchase runs the same path with the Waiting Room steps skipped entirely — `POST /inventory/hold` succeeds immediately since there's no queue to admit from.

IDs, enum values, and endpoint names here are the vocabulary the user stories' acceptance criteria assume — e.g. CU-09's "no seat is ever confirmed to two buyers" is exactly what `InventoryHold` plus the synchronous `/holds/{id}/confirm` call is designed to guarantee.*
